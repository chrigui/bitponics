Kale sprouts? BrusselKale? Flower Sprouts? Whatever you want to call it, I've seen each of those names refer to the hybrid vegetable created by cross-breeding kale and brussels sprouts. I personally call them kale sprouts. There are also similar hybrids such as Petit Vert in Japan that have been around for a while. While the hybrid is not scientifically *all that crazy* (both are from the same [species][1]), there seems to be some sort of media blitz going on around it lately. As ubiquitous as kale is in the US these days, I'm finding it fascinating that a new vegetable incarnation is trending in the media like this. There are new [articles][16] about it [every][13] [day][14], and even a few [companies][2] [putting][3] [money][4] behind the hybrid vegetable, branding it for sale in different markets. It seems like [everybody][5] [wants][6] to [try][7] them.

##This kale/brussels hybrid hails from Japan. 
One study claims it has [anti-obesitic effects][18].

The thing is, for all the hype and talk about them, they aren't easily found locally or readily available for consumption in all areas. You can find them on some [restaurant menus][8] and maybe in a specialty vegetable shop or [farmer's market][11] if you're lucky. They are still pretty tough to come by in most markets. That may be due in part to the confusion caused by the many names it goes by. Maybe I've unknowingly partaken?


According to a recent article in [TODAY][12], a seed company with the "Flower Sprouts" trademark, [Tozer][15], said that they are:


> "...reigning in growers and will officially
> launch the hybrid under one cohesive name this fall."


That may be wishful thinking. The company associations to the vegetable seem to map out like so:


| Name                | Company           | Region  |
|:------------------------|:------------------|:--------|
| *Flower Sprouts*        | [Tozer][2]        | UK    |
| *BrusselKale*         | [Rock Garden][3]  | USA   |
| *Lollipop Kale Sprouts* | [Savoy Salad][4]  | USA   |
| *Petit vert*        | ??              | JAPAN |


Either way, if you can't wait for the launch party, and you're dying to taste this hot new hybrid, *grow it yourself*! I started growing kale sprouts about a week ago. I ordered my seeds from [Johnny's Selected Seeds][9] and planted them in my hydroponic garden. So far, so good.


##My Kale Sprouts - Day X

I've created a new grow plan at [bitponics.com][garden-link] that I plan to update with my findings as the plants progress. Knowing that kale typically takes around 110 days to mature for a full harvest, I'm reminded of a question I recently read on the [Digital Farm Collective][10]:


> "If you knew it took 160 days to grow a carrot, 
> would it change the way you think about the produce you eat?"
